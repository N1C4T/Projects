🍅 Tomato Leaf Disease Detection

This project uses deep learning (CNN) to detect diseases in tomato leaves from images.
The model was trained using the PlantVillage dataset and deployed on Google Cloud with a Flask API for real-time predictions.

📘 Overview

Plant diseases can significantly reduce crop yield and quality. This project aims to build a computer vision model that identifies tomato leaf diseases automatically and accurately.

The trained CNN model (tomatoes.h5) classifies leaf images into multiple disease categories and can be served via a Flask-based API for practical use cases such as agricultural diagnostics or mobile applications.
